Problem Statement
Restaurants often face challenges in efficiently taking, managing, and tracking orders from multiple tables, especially during busy hours. Manual processes lead to errors, delays, and a poor customer experience. There is a need for a simple, digital solution for restaurants to streamline interactions between customers (tables) and kitchen staff.

Scope of the Project
This project focuses on building a basic desktop application for small and medium-sized restaurants. It allows customers to place orders and view bills from table terminals, while kitchen staff manages and fulfills orders using a dedicated interface. The system covers menu display, order creation, billing, and payment simulation, but does not address advanced features like reservations, analytics, or integration with external payment services.

Target Users
Table customers in restaurants (placing orders, viewing bills)
Restaurant staff (managing orders, marking orders as billed)
Restaurant owners/operators (can use/administer the app for smoother operations)

High-Level Features
Menu browsing and selection from a graphical interface
Creation and management of table orders
Separate interface for kitchen staff to track and fulfill orders
Bill calculation, payment simulation, and order status tracking
Modular design for easy future extension
